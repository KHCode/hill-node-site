# README for Kris Hill Personal Portfolio Site

## What This Is
This is the (tiny) engine behind my personal site at [kris-hill.com](http://www.kris-hill.com). I originally had plans to build a Gatsby site, but I was also trying to improve my CSS and learn React at the same time, and I just got kind of lost in all of that. You can see how far I got [here, actually](https://github.com/KHCode/hill-portfolio). So I scaled back and eventually decided on what you have here, which is:

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - NodeJS/Express on the backend

That's it.

## How To Use This
I spent my time trying to make the code base as clear and orderly as possible, for my own sense of pride, but also and as a result, I think this repo is a pretty good starting point for anyone who doesn't know HTML, CSS, or NodeJS/Express very well.

Feel free to use this repo to get your personal site up and running quickly.

If you do use this, let me know! 

## Details...
If you want to use this as a jumping off point for your own project, here are some things you ought to know:

 - Each page on my website has its own GET route
 - Each route responds by sending back a static HTML file
 - All of the HTML files are styled with a single CSS file

Well, that's about it, I hope this is useful.
